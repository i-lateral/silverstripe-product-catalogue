Catalogue Templates
===================

The catalogue module makes use of Silverstripe's templating system
so you can add new Product types easily and then setup associated
templates.

## Adding new templates

Default templates for "Product" and "Category" are provided in this
module's "templates" folder.

Once you add new products types, you can use custom templates for them
by adding a template of the same name as your Product object to your
theme.

## Template Variables

The catalogue module provides several variables to Controller. These
variables should be available globally and accessed via:

    $Catalogue

Currently the catalogue variable provides the following additional
variables:

### List of categories

You can pull a list of categories at any time, and then stipulate the
parent ID for this list, if you want to generate a list of categories in
your template as navigation, then you can use the following code:

    <ul>
      <% loop $Catalogue.Categories %>
        <li><a href="$Link">$Title</a></li>
      <% end_loop %>
    </ul>

### List of products

You can also get a list of products at any point by calling:

    <% loop $Catalogue.Products %>

    <% end_loop %>

You can also add the ID of a parent category for this list as an
argument.
